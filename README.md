## Project Description 
The Wine Recommender System is a sophisticated recommendation engine developed to enhance the wine selection process for businesses across the USA. Catering primarily to B2B clients, the system supports 19 active sales divisions, offering tailored recommendations for both on-premise and off-premise establishments. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the system aims to optimize inventory management, increase sales, and provide a personalized client experience. This approach not only addresses the specific needs of businesses but also enhances overall customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of preferred wines.
